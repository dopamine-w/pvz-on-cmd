# PvZ CMD
A random application that allows you to play Plants vs Zombies on command line because why not?

Currently, this thing isn't even playable. Hopefully though, later on, everything will work as intended. When the test level finally works as intended, I will implement a few goals for this project:

* All PvZ 1 Levels
* All PvZ 1 Zombies
* Minigames
* Plant food?

# Gameplay
How do I intend for this to be played? Answer: By accepting inputs from the player and then showcasing them. Every time the player makes an input the level progresses. I intend for everything to be played by using commands. Like: `plant peashooter 3x5` and a Peashooter appears on row 3 column 5. I think you already know everything else.
