# An update after FOUR months?????? Unreal.
I have a life, you know. Anyways, I lost inspiration to code this for a bit because the code was so horrible. So I decided to
rework the 4 files that have 60 lines of code so that they can be readable to me. And also pumpkin created a problem for
me while I was testing him so expect him to not release for a long time.

# Changes
* Everything that sucked has been reworked.
* Plant and zombie data are now stored in json files (still have yet to add zombies tho...)
* Created an EntityCode class which stores all the functions needed for the plants, so far, at least.
* Pumpkin has been removed because he created such a horrible problem in the code last time. Maybe I'll add him later.

Anyways see you in the very rare next update.
